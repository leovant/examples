# Create a startup script for an application called sleep足walking足server.
# The script should be named sleep足walking and accept "start" and "stop" as arguments. 
# If anything other than "start" or "stop" is provided as an argument, display a usage statement:
# "Usage sleep足walking start|stop" and terminate the script with an exit status of 1.
