# Exercise 1:
# Write a shell script that renames all files in the current directory that end in ".jpg" 
# to begin with today's date in the following format: YYYY足MM足DD.
# Exercise 2:
# Write a script that renames files based on the file extension. 
# The script should prompt the user for a file extension. 
# Next, it should ask the user what prefix to prepend to the file name(s). 
# By default the prefix should be the current date in YYYY足MM足DD format. 
# So, if the user simply presses enter the date will be used. 
# Otherwise, whatever the user entered will be used as the prefix. 
# Next, it should display the original file name and the new name of the file. 
# Finally, it should rename the file.
